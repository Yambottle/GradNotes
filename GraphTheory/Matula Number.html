We illustrate this on the arbitrarily chosen n = 987654321. We label the root of the desired τ (n) by 987654321 = 3 ∗ 3 ∗ 17 ∗ 17 ∗ 379721. Since we have 5 prime factors, the degree of the root is 5. We draw 5 edges from the root and we label their endpoints, for example from left to right, by the orders of these 5 primes, i.e. by 2, 2, 7, 7, 32277 since p2 = 3, p7 = 17, and p32277 = 379721. More conveniently, instead of 32277 we use the label 32277 = 3 ∗ 7 ∗ 29 ∗ 53. Now we repeat this procedure for each of the 5 newly labeled vertices. For example, considering one of the vertices labeled 2, we draw one edge whose endpoint will have the label 1 (the order of the prime 2). This is a leaf of the required tree τ (n) and the procedure stops along this branch. The reader is asked to follow in detail the way the tree τ (987654321) has been obtained (Fig. 2).</div></li></ol><div><br/></div></body></html>
